# Generalised-Additive-Models-GAMs-
Linear Models are considered the Swiss Army Knife of models. There are many adaptations we can make to adapt the model to perform well on a variety of conditions and data types.  Generalised Additive Models (GAMs) are an adaptation that allows us to model non-linear data while maintaining explainability.
